## ❓ Why Public?

Because why not? Me, who has struggled learning React myself for a year, understands how difficult it really is to make a beautiful website without cutting your brain in pieces. I believe people who were inspired by other sleek websites and wants to build one themselves, can use this source code as a guide for them. I think it will be a great learning experience for everyone, and I am more than happy to share my knowledge with the world.
