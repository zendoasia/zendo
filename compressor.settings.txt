# GitHub Workflow Composer Guide
# This compressor is used to automatically create a new release for your repository.
#
# You can use the following placeholders in the config:
# ${COMMIT_HASH}       - The commit hash of the release
# ${REPO_NAME}         - The name of the repository
# ${CONTRIBUTORS_SINCE} - Number of contributors since the last release
# ${WHATS_CHANGED_URL} - URL to the commit history for this release
# ${README_MD}         - Contents of README.md (auto-included)
# ${CHANGELOG_MD}      - Contents of CHANGELOG.md (auto-included)
#
# Important Notes:
# 1. All placeholders (e.g., ${COMMIT_HASH}) are case-sensitive.
# 2. Only one TITLE, DESCRIPTION, and TAG is allowed in the config.
# 3. Each section (TITLE, DESCRIPTION, TAG) must end with "//ASYNC_END".
#
# Example Configuration:
#
# TITLE: Release ${COMMIT_HASH}//ASYNC_END
# DESCRIPTION: Release Notes ${CHANGELOG_MD}//ASYNC_END
# TAG: v${COMMIT_HASH}//ASYNC_END

# Below is some config already set for you:

# IMPORTANT NOTE: TAG CANNOT HAVE SPACES
